# Layer 1: Physical Layer 

## Role and Responsibilities
- Converts binary data (0s and 1s) into signals for transmission over physical media.
- Defines hardware specifications: cables, connectors, voltage levels, timing.
- Deals with physical topology (bus, star, ring).

## Key Functions
- Bit Transmission: Sends raw bits without interpretation.
- Signal Encoding: Electrical, optical, or radio signals.
- Synchronization: Ensures sender and receiver are aligned.
- Data Rate Control: Defines speed (e.g., 10 Mbps, 1 Gbps).

## Devices at Physical Layer
- Hubs: Simple devices that forward electrical signals to all connected ports without filtering.
- Repeaters: Regenerate and amplify signals to extend network distance.
- Cables:
  - Twisted Pair (Cat5, Cat6): Common in LANs.
  - Coaxial: Used in older networks and cable TV.
  - Fiber Optic: High-speed backbone for ISPs and data centers.
- Connectors: RJ45 for Ethernet, SC/ST for fiber optics.
- Patch Panels: Organize cable connections in structured cabling systems.

## Standards
- IEEE 802.3: Defines Ethernet physical layer specifications.
- ITU-T Recommendations: For telecommunication physical interfaces.
- Cable Standards:
  - TIA/EIA-568: Structured cabling standards.
  - ISO/IEC 11801: International cabling standard.
- Physical Media Specs:
  - Cat5 supports up to 100 Mbps.
  - Cat6 supports up to 10 Gbps.

## Common Issues
- Broken or Damaged Cables: Physical wear or cuts.
- Loose Connectors: Improper crimping or insertion.
- Signal Interference: EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) from nearby devices.
- Wrong Cable Type: Using Cat5 for Gigabit Ethernet instead of Cat6.
- Distance Limitations: Exceeding max cable length (e.g., 100m for Ethernet).
- Faulty Hardware: Defective hubs or repeaters.

## Real-World Example
- Plugging an Ethernet cable into your laptop → Physical Layer is active.
- Fiber optic backbone in ISPs → Physical Layer
