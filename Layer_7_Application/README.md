# Layer 7: Application Layer
## Role and Responsibilities
- Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
- Acts as the interface between the user and the network.
- Handles high-level protocols, resource sharing, and remote file access.

## Key Functions
- Service Access: Enables applications to use network resources.
- File Transfer: Allows sending and receiving files.
- Email Services: Provides mail transfer capabilities.
- Name Resolution: Converts domain names to IP addresses (DNS).
- Network Management: SNMP for monitoring and managing devices.

## Devices at Application Layer
(Mostly software-based, but some hardware appliances apply)
- Application Servers: Host services like web, email, FTP.
- Proxy Servers: Act as intermediaries for requests.
- Firewalls (Application Layer): Filter traffic based on application protocols.

## Standards & Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS: Web browsing.
- FTP: File transfer.
- SMTP, POP3, IMAP: Email services.
- DNS: Domain name resolution.
- SNMP: Network management.
- Telnet/SSH: Remote login.

## Common Issues
- DNS Resolution Failures: Cannot resolve domain names.
- HTTP Errors: 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error).
- Email Delivery Problems: SMTP misconfiguration.
- Authentication Failures: Incorrect credentials for services.
- Application-Level Attacks: SQL injection, XSS.

## Real-World Examples
- Browsing a website using HTTP/HTTPS.
- Sending an email via SMTP.
- Downloading files using FTP.
- Resolving domain names via DNS.
